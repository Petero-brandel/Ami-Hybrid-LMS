### For Parents:
1. **Seamless Registration**: Parents from any location (e.g., Ebonyi, Kogi, Kwara, Kaduna) can register their children online, complete legal documentation, and manage tuition payments.
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Parents can track their children’s academic progress, attendance, and performance in real-time.
3. **Payment Management**: A built-in wallet system will notify parents of due payments and provide a transparent overview of tuition fees and balances.

### For Teachers:
1. **Online Recruitment**: Teachers can apply for positions online, undergo interviews, and complete the TEACHERS ON TRAINING program.
2. **GPS-Based Matching**: The system will match teachers with students/homes based on proximity using GPS technology.
3. **Hourly Tracking & Payments**: Tutors’ working hours will be tracked automatically, and their earnings will be calculated based on hourly rates. Teachers can withdraw their earnings at the end of the month.
4. **Resource Access**: Teachers will have access to a comprehensive library of teaching materials and tools to enhance their effectiveness.
