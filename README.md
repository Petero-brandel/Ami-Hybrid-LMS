# Hybrid Education Platform

## Overview

We aim to create a cutting-edge hybrid platform that transcends location and distance barriers, establishing a physical presence across the 36 states of Nigeria, extending to all of Africa, and across the globe.

## Objectives

1. **Parental Access**: Parents in Ebonyi, Kogi, Kwara, Kaduna, or anywhere in the country can seamlessly register their kids online, sign necessary legal documents, pay tuition fees, and monitor their progress.

2. **Teacher Recruitment and Management**: Teachers can apply online from various locations, be invited for interviews, pass the TEACHERS ON TRAINING program, and be employed. The system will match teachers with homes using GPS location tracking. Tutors' hours taught will increment, and their wallet balance will update according to their hourly pay. They will have access to all teaching materials and can withdraw their earnings at the end of the month.

## Management Structure

### 1. National Headquarters
- **General Admin (GA)**: Oversees all business activities, has access to the admin dashboard for performance overviews, manages teacher salaries, and has the final decision-making power.
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Monitor teacher performance and reviews.
    - Sanction underperforming tutors.
    - Control the general running of the business.

### 2. Regional Headquarters
